    /// and comparing. A TOTP cannot: the controller has to compute the very
    /// same token the charging station computed, which means it has to hold the
    /// secret it was computed from. So this is the one thing in the file that a
    /// reader could use, and the file is written for its owner alone - the same
    /// treatment the private keys of the server get, for the same reason.
    ///
    /// <b>Three slots, not one.</b> Two clocks are never quite the same, and a
    /// token that was right when it was sent must still be right when it
    /// arrives. So the token before and the token after are accepted as well,
    /// which widens the window to three times the validity time. That is the
    /// price of not refusing a station whose clock is two seconds off.
