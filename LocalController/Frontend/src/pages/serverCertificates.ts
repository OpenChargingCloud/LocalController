/**
 * The certificates this local controller presents to the charging stations.
 *
 * The page is built around the one thing that is hard about certificates:
 * replacing one before it runs out, without a window in which nothing works.
 * So more than one lives here at a time, the replacement is uploaded the day it
 * arrives even if it only becomes valid in two days, and the controller
 * switches over by itself at the moment it may.
 *
 * Three tabs. **Keys and requests** makes a key and its signing request, and
 * shows each key with the certificate it was given. **All certificates** is
 * every certificate once, by name or by fingerprint, with the key it is for.
 * **Upload** is a box for certificates as text - typed, pasted, or dropped
 * files on - every one of which goes in under the key it belongs to, which the
 * controller works out from the certificate itself: renewals for several keys
 * are pasted at once, and nobody has to know which is whose.
 *
 * There is no way to upload a private key, and saying so on the page is
 * deliberate: the key is made here and never leaves, and somebody looking for
 * the button should find the reason instead. A key that comes along in a file
 * is not put into the box, and its certificate is said to be refused for it.
 *
 * Drawn by view.ts: a draw changes only what differs, so that a certificate
 * pasted under one key outlives another key being made or removed - and the
 * upload, half filled in, outlives a look at another tab.
